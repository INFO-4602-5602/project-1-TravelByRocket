# Project 1 README
## Collaboration
I worked in tandem with Jocelyne Agboglo for portions of the project, but we did not work on the same code. Steve Smart helped me understand and implement onClick for Part 2.

## Modifications
To correct the line graph for Part 3, I sorted the data with Excel before importing it with D3

## Bells and Whistles
None pursued, but I do believe that I completed 100% of the base assignment
